# Introduction

This repository contains the code and documentation for a fire fighting boat control system. The system is designed to control a boat equipped with water guns using a PS4 controller. It was developed as part of a competition held at a Japanese university in Egypt.

# Features

Control the boat's movement: The PS4 controller's joysticks allow for precise control of the boat's movement in all directions.
Control the camera direction: The controller's buttons enable the user to adjust the camera's direction to enhance situational awareness.
Fire water guns: The system includes the functionality to fire water guns mounted on the boat using the controller's buttons.
Speed control: The controller's triggers and buttons allow for adjusting the speed of the boat and water guns.

# Getting Started

To use the control system, follow these steps:

1-Connect the PS4 controller to the computer.

2-Ensure the Arduino board is connected to the computer via USB.

3-Upload the Arduino code provided in the repository to the Arduino board.

4-Run the Python code provided to establish the serial connection between the computer and the Arduino board.

5-Use the PS4 controller to control the boat's movement, camera direction, and firing of the water guns.

# Requirements

1-PS4 controller

2-Arduino board

3-Python 3.x

4-Pygame library

5-Serial library

# Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with the system, please follow these steps:

1-Check the connections between the PS4 controller, Arduino board, and computer.
2-Ensure that the Arduino code is uploaded correctly to the board.
3-Verify that the Python code is running without any errors and establishing a serial connection.
